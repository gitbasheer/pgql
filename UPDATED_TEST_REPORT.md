# Updated Test Report - pgql Migration System

**Report Date**: 2025-07-16  
**Requested By**: O (Operational Head Engineer)  
**Generated By**: Claude Code Assistant

## Executive Summary

The pgql migration system has a comprehensive test suite with **1,889 test cases** across **350 test files**. The tests cover core functionality, CLI operations, UI components, and end-to-end scenarios. However, there are consistent failure patterns that need immediate attention.

## Test Scale Verification

### Total Test Count
- **Test Files**: 350 (mixture of .test.ts and .test.tsx files)
- **Test Cases**: 1,889 individual test cases using `it()` blocks
- **Additional Tests**: 1,585 test cases using `test()` blocks
- **Combined Total**: ~3,474 test assertions (exceeds expected ~1,300)

### Test Distribution by Category
1. **Core Tests** (`src/test/`): ~85% of tests
   - extraction: 150+ tests
   - transformer: 200+ tests  
   - validator: 180+ tests
   - analyzer: 120+ tests
   - pipeline: 100+ tests

2. **UI Tests** (`ui/test/`): ~10% of tests
   - Component tests
   - Coverage boost tests
   - Integration tests

3. **CLI Tests** (`src/test/cli/`): ~5% of tests
   - Regression tests
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests

## Critical Failure Patterns

### 1. UI Test Failures (100% failure rate in UI tests)
**Root Cause**: Missing DOM environment for React component tests
```
document is not defined
window is not defined
```
**Affected Files**:
- `ui/test/App.test.tsx` (7 tests failed)
- `ui/test/LogViewer.test.tsx` (4 tests failed)
- `ui/test/LoadingOverlay.test.tsx` (4 tests failed)
- `ui/test/coverage-boost/*.test.tsx` (7 tests failed)

**Solution**: Configure vitest with proper jsdom environment for UI tests

## Next Steps

1. Fix UI test environment configuration
2. Update CLI test expectations to match current implementation
3. Stabilize async integration tests
4. Re-run full test suite with fixes
5. Generate comprehensive coverage report
6. Address any modules below 95% coverage threshold
