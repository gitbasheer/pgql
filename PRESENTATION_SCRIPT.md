# GraphQL Migration Tool - Presentation Script

## The Problem We Solved

**VNEXT-65212** required manually migrating all GraphQL queries from deprecated PG schema fields. But we had a huge problem:

- Queries use complex templates with variables
- Dynamic fragments are resolved at runtime  
- No way to know how many queries exist upfront
- Manual work would take weeks and risk missing queries

## What We Built

An **automated migration pipeline** that does all the heavy lifting:

### 1. Query Discovery
- Finds ALL GraphQL queries in our codebase automatically
- Resolves templates and variables to get real queries
- Extracts fragments and builds complete query definitions

### 2. Smart Analysis  
- Compares queries against the new PG schema
- Identifies deprecated fields automatically
- No hardcoded mappings - schema-driven discovery

### 3. Automated Transformation
- Transforms queries to use new schema fields
- Validates transformations work correctly
- Tests against real PG endpoints

### 4. Response Compatibility
- Transforms new responses back to old format
- Zero breaking changes to our app
- Seamless migration with feature flags

## Key Benefits

**Time Savings**: Weeks of manual work ‚Üí Automated in hours

**Zero Risk**: Response validation ensures no data loss

**Future-Proof**: Works with any GraphQL service migration

**Team Ready**: UI dashboard for monitoring and validation

## üîß **Technical Architecture** (4 minutes)

### **1. Query Extraction**
**"First, we find all the queries."**
- Scans JavaScript files for GraphQL templates
- Resolves variables like `${queryNames.allV1}`
- Substitutes fragments automatically
- Found 35+ queries from 8 files

### **2. Schema Analysis**
**"Then we figure out what's broken."**
- Reads GraphQL schema deprecation messages
- Maps old fields to new fields
- No hardcoded rules - adapts to any schema changes

### **3. Smart Transformation**
**"Next, we fix the queries."**
- `displayName` ‚Üí `name`
- `ventures` ‚Üí `ventures(first: 10)`
- Adds modern GraphQL patterns like `__typename`

### **4. Response Validation**
**"Finally, we make sure nothing breaks."**
- Calls both old and new APIs
- Compares responses automatically
- Creates transformation functions for backward compatibility

**"Let me show you the UI we built."**

### **Dashboard Features:**
1. **Auth Testing** - "Check if credentials work"
2. **Extract Queries** - "Find all GraphQL operations"
3. **View Results** - "See exactly what was found"
