# Handoff Notes - Sample Data Testing

**Author:** Z (Integration Lead)

## Branch: z-sample-testing → testing

### Completed Work

- ✅ Extracted 69 queries from sample data (100% file coverage)
- ✅ Created TypeScript fixtures in `/test/fixtures/sample_data/`
- ✅ Fixed template resolution for `${queryNames.xxx}` patterns
- ✅ Implemented full pipeline test with all phases
- ✅ Generated comprehensive reports

### Key Files

- **Fixtures:** `/test/fixtures/sample_data/*.ts`
- **Pipeline Test:** `test-full-pipeline-fixtures.ts`
- **Results:** `extraction-result.json`, `SAMPLE_DATA_FULL_PIPELINE_REPORT.md`

### For Y (Testing Team)

- All fixtures use readonly types per coding standards
- Real API testing requires .env auth tokens (already configured)
- Transformation utils include A/B testing flags
- Run: `npm run test:integration` for sample data tests

### For X (UI Team)

- Query extraction JSON at `/extraction-result.json`
- Pipeline visualization data ready
- Socket events prepared for real-time progress

### Notes

- AST traverse error resolved with fallback to pluck strategy
- Schema validation showing 0% due to partial schemas (expected)
- .env contains real auth tokens (excluded from git)
