What Problem Are We Solving?
Manual migration of GraphQL queries is slow, error-prone, and risky.
Complex queries use templates, variables, and dynamic fragmentsâ€”hard to track and migrate by hand.
We need to find and fix all deprecated fields in our queries, but the true scope is hidden.
Our Automated Solution
Automated extraction: Finds every query, even those built with templates and variables.
Fragment resolution: Automatically includes all fragments, even dynamic ones.
Schema-driven validation: Checks every query against the latest schema, finds deprecated fields, and suggests fixes.
Automated transformation: Updates queries to use new schema fields.
Reverse mapping: Links every change back to the exact source file and line.
Response validation: Runs both old and new queries, compares results, and ensures no data loss.
Universal design: Works with any GraphQL service, not just PG.
Progress tracking: Real-time dashboard and validation reports.
